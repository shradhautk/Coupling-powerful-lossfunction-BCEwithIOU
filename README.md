Uniting Binary Cross-Entropy with IOU for Improved Segmentation Performance

This code employs SegNet for evaluating segmentation performance by combining two loss functions, rather than using a single one. It differs from the standard IOU metric used for evaluation, which typically assesses segmentation or object detection quality. This composite loss function integrates IOU with binary cross-entropy loss and label smoothing to promote effective segmentation while maintaining smooth predictions during training.

The advantage of fusing Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) with Intersection over Union (IOU) in a loss function lies in its capacity to enhance segmentation tasks. It facilitates smoother training with reduced overfitting, courtesy of BCE's label smoothing. This hybrid loss function encourages precise object localization (IOU) and pixel-wise accuracy (BCE), striking a balance between precision and recall. It expedites model convergence by guiding shape and spatial learning. Moreover, IOU functions as a regularization term, aiding in handling class imbalances. The loss function's flexibility allows for customization through parameter adjustments. Overall, it augments segmentation models by simultaneously addressing accuracy, localization, and robustness."
